(for online tiddlywiki)

See https://github.com/jdlrobson/tiddlywebwikii for jon's version
on which this is based. I made a different one because I was struggling
to get my head around the concepts, fix the issues, and otherwise know
what's up. Out of the two should come the correct thing, either this
one will inform that one, or if this one becomes the thing, then
this one would not be possible without that one as the guide.

The differences are or will be:

are
* cooking of the tiddlywiki is local to this repo, so it is easier
to mess about with removing or adding pieces of tiddlywiki
* ditto for the pieces of javascript, and the overrides
* fixed a big bug in how the WIKI global was being used
(after the first wiki all the following wiki's would have the
same host info)
* no concept of a "latest" build, there is just this build
* more integration with tiddlywebwiki

will be
* proper handling of the download arg
* more stuff stripped away
* integration with lazytiddlywebwiki
* tests (oops)
